Living in different places and cultures gave me\n              a brought scope of life experiences, openness and a capacity of\n              non-judgment when it comes to human diversity. I have a Master’s\n              degree in Family Therapy from Universidad del Noreste, in Tampico,\n              Tamaulipas, Mexico and a Master’s degree in Clinical Psychology\n              from Antioch University Los Angeles. Apart of the theoretical\n              knowledge, Universidad del Noreste taught me a lot about Mexican\n              couples and families and Antioch University taught me a great deal\n              about minorities, discrimination, social justice and again human\n              diversity. I have been practicing psychotherapy for 15+ years. I\n              did a 2-year and 5-month internship at the Jung Institute of Los\n              Angeles, where I received training in Jungian-oriented\n              psychotherapy, which I continued by working as an intern with Dr.\n              Susan Frankel, certified Jungian analyst, in her private practice\n              for another year and 8 months. I hold a Certificate in Jungian\n              Studies and a Certificate in Individual Systemic Therapy.\n              Currently I am enrolled in a 3-year Somatic Experiencing training\n              program in order to get certified as a Somatic Experiencing\n              Practitioner.\n            </Text>\n          </SecondSection>\n        </SectionsWrapper>\n      </SectionA>\n      <SectionA>\n        <SectionsWrapper>\n          <SecondSection>\n            <Text>\n              What I am like as a therapist I'm a very empathetic, compassionate\n              person and I'm easily touched by people's stories. I am passionate\n              about what I do and I love helping people to feel more accepting\n              of themselves and loving themselves the way they are. It is very\n              rewarding to me to see people heal and becoming happier and more\n              authentic. I feel intrigued to investigate with you what is going\n              on inside you, in your unconscious (the part of our mind we\n              normally don't have access to, but that largely influences what we\n              feel, think and how we act). When I listen to people's stories, I\n              suspend all judgment. I believe that we all do our best with the\n              resources and limitations we have and the baggage we carry around\n              as a result of trauma and other difficult life situations. I value\n              the trust my patients put in me and we develop strong\n              relationships over time. Most of my patients have been working\n              with me over the course of at least two years. I care deeply for\n              all of them and I have been honored to be the witness of their\n              progress and growth.\n            </Text>\n          </SecondSection>\n          <FirstSection>\n            <ImageWrapper>\n              {' '}\n              <StaticImage\n                src=\"../images/lake-tree.jpg\"\n                alt=\"lake-tree\"\n                placeholder=\"blurred\"\n                layout=\"fullWidth\"\n              />\n            </ImageWrapper>\n          </FirstSection>\n        </SectionsWrapper>\n      </SectionA>\n      <SectionB>\n        <Quote>\n          “The time came, when the pain of remaining tightly in a bud became\n          greater, than the risk it took to blossom.” -Anaïs Nin\n        </Quote>\n        <ImageWrapper>\n          <StaticImage\n            src=\"../images/buds.jpg\"\n            alt=\"buds\"\n            placeholder=\"blurred\"\n            layout=\"fullWidth\"\n          />\n        </ImageWrapper>\n      </SectionB>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default about;\n\nexport const Head = () => {\n  <SEO\n    title=\"Our Unique Approach to Psychotherapy in California | Heal, Grow, Connect\"\n    description=\"Discover our California-based online therapy practice and learn about our approach to healing and growth.
